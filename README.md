# AWS Project 1: EC2 Web Server

This is my first AWS project, where I deployed a basic Apache web server on an Amazon EC2 instance.

### 🛠️ What I Did
- Launched an Amazon EC2 instance (Amazon Linux 2).
- Installed and started the Apache HTTP server.
- Configured the security group to allow HTTP traffic on port 80.
- Verified the setup by accessing the web server using the public IP address.

### 💡 AWS Services Used
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
- Security Groups
- IAM (for access)

### 🔍 What I Learned
- How to launch and connect to an EC2 instance.
- How to install packages using the command line.
- How to configure basic network access through security groups.
- How public IPs allow web access to EC2-hosted content.

This is a simple project, but it helped me get hands-on with core AWS services and build confidence using the AWS Console.
